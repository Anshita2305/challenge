## Production Readiness

Before deploying this project to a production environment, consider the following tasks to ensure robustness, security, and scalability:

### 1. Error Handling and Validation
- **Enhanced Validation**: Implement input validation to prevent invalid or malicious data.
- **Custom Exception Handling**: Introduce custom exceptions for more descriptive error handling and appropriate HTTP responses.

### 2. Logging and Monitoring
- **Extended Logging**: Add detailed logging for transactions and errors.
- **Monitoring**: Integrate monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to track application performance and health.

### 3. Security
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Implement security measures to control access to the API.
- **Data Encryption**: Ensure encryption of sensitive data both in transit and at rest.

### 4. Performance and Scalability
- **Optimize Performance**: Conduct performance testing and optimization.
- **Scalability Testing**: Test the application under load to ensure it scales effectively.

### 5. Data Integrity and Transactions
- **Atomic Transactions**: Use transactions to ensure data consistency during transfers.

### 6. Configuration Management
- **Externalize Configuration**: Manage configuration settings through environment variables or configuration management tools.

### 7. Testing and Quality Assurance
- **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: Expand unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
- **Load Testing**: Validate application behavior under high load conditions.

### 8. Documentation
- **API Documentation**: Provide detailed API documentation (e.g., Swagger/OpenAPI).

### 9. Deployment and CI/CD
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
- **Deployment Strategy**: Define strategies for deployment, including rollback procedures and zero-downtime deployment.
